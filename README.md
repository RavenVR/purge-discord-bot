### Setup
To set up the bot, first open your command line in the discord bots folder then run this:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
now open bot.py and change the guild_id to your server id and change the token to your discord bots token.
now invite your bot to your server with admin permissions then there you have it!

## help:
/purge amount: allows you to purge a certain ammount of msgs within a span of 14 days.

## Info
this bot already checks if someone has a channed, so if they do, they cant just spam channels.
